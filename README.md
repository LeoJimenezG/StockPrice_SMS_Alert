# StockPrice_SMS_Alert ðŸ“ˆ

A small project to receive SMS alerts with information about a specific company, using [Twilio](https://shorturl.at/QYo2T), [News API](https://newsapi.org/), and [Alpha Vantage](https://www.alphavantage.co/) APIs.

---

## ðŸ“˜ How Does It Work?

1. **Stock Data Retrieval**  
   The program takes a company's ticker symbol (e.g., `TSLA` for Tesla) to fetch its stock market information from [Alpha Vantage](https://www.alphavantage.co/).

2. **Price Difference Calculation**  
   - It calculates the difference between the closing price of the current day and the previous day.  
   - Adjustments may apply depending on factors like time zones or non-working days.  

3. **News Retrieval**  
   - If the price difference exceeds 5%, the program fetches the latest news about the company from [News API](https://newsapi.org/).  
   - It selects the first three relevant articles.

4. **SMS Notification**  
   - Using [Twilio](https://shorturl.at/QYo2T), the program sends three SMS messages to the specified phone number with the price difference and news headlines.

If everything works correctly, the receiver will get **three SMS messages** with stock market updates and news for the selected company.
